                That said, nothing good comes from getting to much of something. I depended on games as
                 a crutch to help me deal with issues I faced during school, to the point of neglecting 
                 my studies out of an apathy formed from seeing teachers not care about obvious cheating,
                 as well as my dislike of most subject I had.
